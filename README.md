### Project Brief:
- Game to display in browser
- Incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- DOM manipulation which allows scripts to dynamically access content, structure and style of documents; updating the data of the page without the need to refresh

An adaptation of coin-op video arcade game Space Invaders. The goal is to defeat a wave of descending swarm of aliens, using a horizontal moving spaceship, firing at as many aliens possible.

### MVP:
- Canvas of 800 x 600 px (w x h)
- A spaceship (the player) and few rows of aliens
- Spaceship to shoot aliens
- Aliens to move downwards as game proceeds

### Other Features:
- Typography to reflect pixel-like game
- Scoreboard when alien is shot
- Player no. of lives 
- If bullet misses alien, game continues 
- Game start, pause, over

### Agile Workflow:
- Build components of game into smaller segments before putting them 
- Components: GameCanvas, player, spaceship, aliens, bullets, scoring, lives
